# Fediverse Desktop App

This is a fork of electron-quick-start which is being built into a Fediverse desktop app.

**The app is currently not finished or operational!**

In the first version, you will just be able to load up your instance and sign on exactly as you would a browser, however in future versions I intend to add  more functionality to the menu bars above the program, list this on the macOS app store, and eventually a recommendation system which will recommend popular users. This will not happen until later down the pipeline.

There's no reason this shouldn't be compatible with all your favorite Fediverse instances.

You can learn more about [the Fediverse here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) and you can learn about the most popular instances statistics [here](https://fediverse.network/) and there's a cool graphic about some of the instances [here](https://fediverse.party/).
