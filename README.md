# Fediverse Desktop App

This is a fork of electron-quick-start which is being built into a Fediverse desktop app.

**It is not currently finished and has no easy installation**

At the moment this is an exceptionally simple project which will accept an instance and will render it as a website. More functionality to come. There's no reason this shouldn't be compatible with all your favorite Fediverse instances.

You can learn more about [the Fediverse here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) and you can learn about the most popular instances statistics [here](https://fediverse.network/). Additionally here is a cool graphic about some of the instances [here](https://fediverse.party/).

## Usage

If you want to use this project, you can simply run it with node as such:

```
npm install
npm start
```

And then enter your instance.
